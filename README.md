# Cybersecurity Learning Roadmap

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive learning roadmap for anyone interested in pursuing a career in cybersecurity, including security informatics, ethical hacking, and related fields. The roadmap is designed to guide learners from a junior level to more advanced stages, covering essential topics and skills needed to excel in the field.

## Structure
The roadmap is divided into several stages, with each stage focusing on key areas of knowledge and expertise. 

### Junior Level
At the Junior level, the focus is on building a strong foundation in essential skills and knowledge areas. This stage covers:

- **Scripting:** Learning scripting languages like Python and Bash is crucial for automating tasks, managing systems, and conducting security assessments.
  - Basics of Python and Bash scripting
  - Writing automation scripts
  - Handling files, directories, and processes
  - Developing small tools for security tasks
  
- **Networking Fundamentals:** Understanding how networks operate is vital for cybersecurity.
  - TCP/IP model and protocols
  - Basic network configurations and troubleshooting
  - Network security principles
  
- **Operating Systems:** Gaining proficiency in different operating systems, with a focus on Linux and Windows.
  - Linux command line essentials
  - Windows internals and PowerShell
  - OS security best practices

- **Version Control:** Familiarizing with version control systems, primarily Git, is essential for managing code and collaborating with others.
  - Git basics
  - Repository management
  - Collaboration workflows
  
- **Introduction to Ethical Hacking:** An overview of ethical hacking principles and methodologies.
  - Types of hacking and legal considerations
  - Reconnaissance and information gathering
  - Basic vulnerability assessment

## Future Stages
The roadmap will later delve into more advanced topics, including but not limited to:

- Intermediate Level: Advanced scripting, penetration testing, web application security, cryptography, and security frameworks.
- Senior Level: Incident response, threat hunting, advanced threat modeling, secure software development, and leadership skills.

## How to Use This Roadmap
- Follow the roadmap step by step, dedicating time to each topic.
- Engage with the community, contribute to open-source projects, and participate in CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges.
- Keep updating your knowledge with the latest trends and threats in cybersecurity.
